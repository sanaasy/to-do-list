### FOR THIS WORKSHOP, YOU WILL NEED:
- an IDE (I recommend VS Code)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A terminal

## Installing and Setting up Expo
Follow the steps [here](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) to install Expo.
#### TL;DR
1. macOS and Linux users need to download [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install#buildinstall)
2. Open your terminal and create an expo account using the command `npx expo register` (if you already have an expo account use `npx expo login`)
3. Download the Expo Go App on your phone
You're good to go!

## Setting up your expo project
Once you've successfully set up your Expo CLI and have downloaded the Expo Go app, you're ready to create a project! Expo will set you up with all the base code you need to start building your To do list app.

1. Create a project named <your-name>-to-do-list by running the command `npx create-expo-app <your-name>-to-do-list` in your terminal. (Make sure to do this in a location on your computer that you can find easily later on!)
    > You should see something like this when your project has been created:
    <img src='assets/setupexpoproject.png' width=250 style='display: block; margin: auto;' /> 
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd <you-name>-to-do-list`.

## Starting your development server
1. Run `npx expo start` and wait for a QR code to pop up in your terminal.
2. For Android users, press "Scan QR Code" on the "Home" tab of the Expo Go app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal. For Apple users, open the default Apple "Camera" app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal.

Once you see a screen that shows up like this, you're ready to start building! ðŸ¥³

> You can play around with the code in the `App.js` if you want to get more familiar with how React Native apps are set up.
